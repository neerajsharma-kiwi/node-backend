For the Backend, we are using node + Mongo DB

Extract the 'backend' folder also you would need Mongo DB on the system to be installed.

In the project directory, you can run:
###  `npm install`
### `npm start`

Folder "database/db.js" needs to add the database name and connection URL of  Mongo DB.
